# HEADS UP !

This is not actually a new release, but a final one on pypi.

Pypi has proven to be anti free speech. Hence, you're not gonna see any more updates to this module on here. I keep updating the module on [https://gitea.ksol.io](https://gitea.ksol.io), in fact there are already a couple new versions released ever since 1.0.5.

For future updates, you'll have to update your module source. For more information, see the [updated README](https://gitea.ksol.io/karolyi/py3-validate-email/src/branch/master/README.md)

Let's keep things free and decentralized.
